                <p class="blog-lead">Certain dishes are more than just food; they are a piece of culinary history. Butter Chicken, or Murgh Makhani, is one such dish, and its story is directly tied to the legacy of Moti Mahal, the renowned restaurant housed within Surya Plaza Hotel.</p>

                <h2>The Inventor: Kundan Lal Gujral</h2>
                <p>The origin of Butter Chicken is credited to Kundan Lal Gujral in the 1920s in Peshawar, before the partition of India. Gujral was a chef at a restaurant where he was already popularizing another of his inventions: Tandoori Chicken. The challenge he faced was what to do with the leftover tandoori chicken, which tended to dry out.</p>

                <h2>The Innovation: A Sauce Born of Necessity</h2>
                <p>To solve this problem, Gujral developed a rich, velvety gravy to rehydrate the chicken pieces. This sauce, known as "makhani" (buttery), was a simple yet transformative combination of tomatoes, butter, and cream, balanced with subtle spices.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Key Components:</strong> The sauce's base is pureed tomatoes, simmered for hours to reduce and concentrate the flavor.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Magic Ingredient:</strong> The addition of butter (makhan) and a touch of cream gives the dish its signature richness and balances the acidity of the tomatoes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>He would simmer the leftover tandoori chicken in this makhani sauce, creating a dish that would become a global phenomenon. After the partition, Gujral moved to Delhi and established the Moti Mahal restaurant, where Butter Chicken and his other invention, Dal Makhani, became legendary.</p>

                <h2>Experience the Legacy at Surya Plaza</h2>
