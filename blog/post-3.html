                <p class="blog-lead">When designing the accommodations at Surya Plaza Hotel, our philosophy was guided by a simple question: what do travelers truly need for a comfortable and restorative stay? The answer went beyond just a bed and a bathroom. It was about creating functional, private, and thoughtfully appointed spaces. This is particularly evident in the design of our suites.</p>

                <h2>The Importance of a Private Balcony</h2>
                <p>A key feature in many of our rooms, especially our suites, is the inclusion of a private balcony. In a city setting, having a personal outdoor space provides a valuable sense of openness. It’s a place to enjoy a morning cup of tea, read a book, or simply observe the city's rhythm without leaving the comfort of your room. For rooms with a view of the Ganga, the balcony becomes a private vantage point to watch the river's timeless flow.</p>

                <h2>Creating a Separate Living Space</h2>
                <p>A hotel room can sometimes feel restrictive, especially during longer stays or when traveling with family. Our Junior and Premium Suites were designed to solve this by incorporating a separate living or drawing room. This functional separation provides several benefits:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Work-Life Balance:</strong> It allows one guest to work at a desk or take a call without disturbing another who may be resting in the bedroom.</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Space:</strong> It provides a comfortable area to host a visitor or for family members to gather without congregating in the sleeping area.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced Comfort:</strong> With spaces like our 700 sq. ft. Two-Bedroom Suite, this separation creates an apartment-like feel, making it a true home away from home.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Functionality in Every Detail</h2>
                <p>Our design process also focused on practical amenities that cater to the needs of modern travelers. This includes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ample Lighting and Power Outlets:</strong> Well-lit spaces with conveniently located outlets for charging devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dedicated Workspaces:</strong> Rooms are equipped with a desk and chair, recognizing the needs of our business guests.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Furnishings:</strong> From plush bedding to comfortable sofas, every piece is chosen for both durability and comfort.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By focusing on these core principles—private outdoor space, functional separation, and thoughtful details—we aim to provide an environment that is not just a place to stay, but a space to live comfortably.</p>
