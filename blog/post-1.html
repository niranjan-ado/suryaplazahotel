                <p class="blog-lead">Sahibganj, a district rich in natural beauty and history, offers a unique blend of scenic landscapes and cultural landmarks. Situated along the Ganga, it provides a compelling destination for a weekend of exploration. This guide outlines a practical itinerary to help you experience some of the key attractions in the region, using Surya Plaza Hotel as your base.</p>

                <h2>Day 1: Waterfalls and Temples</h2>
                
                <h3>Morning: Moti Jharna Waterfall</h3>
                <p>Begin your day with a trip to Moti Jharna, a waterfall located within the Rajmahal hills. The falls cascade over two distinct rock ledges, creating a serene environment, particularly during the post-monsoon season. The surrounding area is characterized by lush greenery, offering a quiet space for nature photography or simply enjoying the calm.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Location:</strong> Approx. 14 km from Surya Plaza Hotel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Travel Time:</strong> About a 35-minute drive.</li>
                    <li><strong>Note:</strong> The flow of water is seasonal and is most prominent from July to October.</li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Akbari Masjid:</strong> One of the older mosques in the area, showcasing Mughal architectural elements.</li>
                    <li><strong>Singhi Dalan:</strong> The remains of Sultan Shah Shujaâ€™s palace, offering a glimpse into the region's royal past.</li>
                </ul>
